# SPFx Jack

Helper to automate steps after initialising a new SPFx project. Currently supports [ SPFx Fast Serve](https://github.com/s-KaiNet/spfx-fast-serve) and [Sync Version](https://n8d.at/how-to-version-new-sharepoint-framework-projects)

# Disclaimer

I built this as I repeatidly do these things every time I start a new project.

The intent is to have as many 'independent' commands to cover the most common scenarios.
